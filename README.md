# dotfiles

Dotfiles [used by GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account)

I share sets of dotfiles with others.  This repository is mainly a set of scripts to pull those all together when setting up a development environment.
